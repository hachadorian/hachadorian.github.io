          i continue to learn more about front-end development each day.
          recently i have been working with react a ton and have really been
          enjoying the workflow of the library. i even decided to create this
          site with react and i think it came out pretty nice. i also choose to
          learn a new css framework for this site. the framework i chose was
          tailwind. in college we used a ton of bootstrap but i like how much
          more control tailwind gives to the dev. additionally i have been going
          through the fullstackopen course and have been learning about
          fullstack js development. the course also goes through other trendy
          technologies like graphql for example.
